# miata-tail-lights

Repo for my React native/Node project to run bluetooth miata rear lights.

## Issues to solve

- Storage
  - ~~Check if saving works~~
  - ~~Display saved Presets~~
  - ~~Load saved Presets~~
  - ~~Edit saved Presets~~
- Make sending step
  - Make bluetooth work.
  - Send data with Bluetooth
  - Make microcontroller (probably arduino) accept serialised json
- Make animation preset
- Solve Brake / Turn signal on/off (possibly make them have custom presets too)

## Non code related issues

- Create pcb
- Write code for arduino or whatever I will use
- Add branch for led underglow
- Probably upload arduino code here to have everythign in one repo.
